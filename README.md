## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

The overall purpose of the challenge was to use our knowledge of VBA and use the starter code provided to refractor the Module2_VBA_Script. As we did in the module, we will do this to loop through and collect all of the 2017 and 2018 stock analysis data one time. However, our goal this time will be to see whether refractoring the code made the VBA_script run faster this time. In essence, there are many times in which we have to increase efficiency in writing code on the job and our objective here is to determine whether refractoring does in fact increase efficiency.   

### **Data**

The stock analysis data that is provided includes two sheets of data on twelve different stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. Additionally, the data is broken down by a ticker index, when the stock was issued, the stock opening and closing values, the stock high and low values, its adjusted close value and the stock total daily volume. The objective with the data is to acquire the tickers, total daily volume and ultimately the return percentage.
